# DL-Identification

I used 'commpy.channels.bsc' to translate 'bsc' in the given matlab code. I am sure that they have the same functionality. There is a small problem of one local initialization file when using 'commpy.channels.bsc'. I have modified that file with a guidance I found online (https://github.com/veeresht/CommPy/blob/master/commpy/__init__.py). You also need to modify this file and also include the given matlab code (a list of functions) into the your project folder, where your translated python code exists. Last but not least, please install the matlab engine.
